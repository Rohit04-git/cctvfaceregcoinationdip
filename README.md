Face Recognition and Matching Using CLIP and OpenCV
This project is a Python-based face recognition and matching tool that leverages OpenCV for face detection and OpenAI's CLIP model for image embedding and similarity comparison. It is designed to extract faces from an input image, compute their embeddings, and match them against a dataset of images to find the closest matches.

Features
Face Detection:
Utilizes OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to accurately detect and extract faces from input images.

Image Preprocessing:
Enhances detection accuracy by resizing, denoising, and improving image contrast before face extraction.

Deep Embedding with CLIP:
Employs the pre-trained CLIP (ViT-B/16) model from Hugging Face Transformers to generate robust image embeddings for both extracted faces and dataset images.

Similarity Matching:
Compares face embeddings with dataset embeddings using cosine similarity to identify the best match, with a configurable similarity threshold.

Batch Processing:
Supports precomputing and storing embeddings for all images in a dataset folder for efficient repeated comparisons.

Modular Design:
Functions are organized for easy extension or integration into larger systems.

How It Works
Input:

User provides the path to an input image and a dataset folder containing reference images.

Preprocessing:

The input image is resized, denoised, and converted to grayscale with enhanced contrast for optimal face detection.

Face Extraction:

Detected faces are cropped and saved to an output folder.

Embedding Calculation:

Each face image and each dataset image is processed through the CLIP model to obtain a normalized feature embedding.

Matching:

For each extracted face, the script computes cosine similarity with all dataset embeddings and reports the best match if the similarity exceeds the defined threshold.

Usage
Dependencies:

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Pillow (PIL)

Transformers (Hugging Face)

Pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file

Run the Script:

Ensure all dependencies are installed.

Place the Haar Cascade XML file in the specified directory.

Execute the script and follow the prompts to provide the input image and dataset folder paths.

Example Applications
Face verification and identification in photo collections.

Automated tagging or grouping of images based on facial similarity.

Preprocessing for larger face recognition or clustering systems.

Customization
Threshold Adjustment:
The similarity threshold can be tuned for stricter or more lenient matching.

Model Replacement:
Swap the CLIP model or adjust preprocessing steps to fit different recognition tasks or datasets.

Integration:
Easily integrate into web applications, desktop tools, or larger machine learning pipelines.

Notes
The script is intended for educational and research purposes.

For best results, ensure high-quality, front-facing images in both the input and dataset folders.

The Haar Cascade XML path and other parameters can be modified as needed for your environment.
